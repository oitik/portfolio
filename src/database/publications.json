This study explores a unique hybrid approach, merging deep learning with traditional machine learning for accurate brain tumor detection and classification. Alongside, a custom CCNN+ML hybrid method was implemented, further refining results. MRI images were enhanced using Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) to optimize feature quality, boosting diagnostic precision.",
