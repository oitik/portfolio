            "description": "The paper explores the classification of Bengali sentences, a crucial area for advancing natural language processing (NLP) in linguistically rich languages. Using a recently published Bengali sentence dataset (BTSD) of 3,793 samples, the study applies BERT-based, Glove-based, and TF-IDF-based vectorization approaches, achieving a notable ***98.07%*** accuracy with BERT-based vectorization. This underscores its potential for real-world applications beyond the dataset. The findings contribute to a deeper understanding of Bengali sentence structures, with implications for computational linguistics and NLP research.",

A novel approach is proposed to identify and resolve inconsistencies, followed by applying the state-of-the-art BERT model for sentiment and emotion recognition. Results show significant accuracy improvements: sentiment analysis accuracy increased from **93.96% to 96.31%**, and emotion analysis improved from **90.94% to 93.59%** after data cleaning. Comparative analyses highlight the effectiveness of this approach, emphasizing discrepancy detection as a crucial preprocessing step for enhancing insights into consumer behavior.",

The model integrates Explainable AI (XAI) techniques for transparency and employs dropout to prevent overfitting, achieving 99% accuracy. The inclusion of XAI enables word-level contribution visualizations, offering insights into symptom influence. This model demonstrates higher accuracy and faster training times, making it both effective and computationally efficient for medical applications.",
